- **Desktop App**: Create desktop applications with Electron
- **Browser Extension**: Build a browser extension for quick access
- **CLI Version**: Implement a command-line interface for terminal users

## Implementation Priorities

Based on user value and implementation complexity, here's a suggested prioritization of these enhancements:

### Short-term (High Value, Lower Complexity)

1. **Local Storage Persistence**: Save todos between sessions
2. **Filter and Sort Options**: Allow filtering by status and basic sorting
3. **Dark Mode**: Implement a light/dark theme toggle
4. **Due Dates**: Add basic due date functionality
5. **Improved Keyboard Navigation**: Enhance accessibility

### Medium-term (Moderate Complexity)

1. **Subtasks**: Implement hierarchical todos
2. **Search Functionality**: Add text-based search
3. **Tags/Categories**: Implement basic categorization
4. **Drag and Drop Reordering**: Improve the list management UX
5. **Export/Import**: Allow data portability

### Long-term (Higher Complexity)

1. **Cloud Sync**: Implement data synchronization
2. **Collaboration Features**: Add sharing and multi-user support
3. **Notifications System**: Create a comprehensive notification system
4. **Mobile/Desktop Apps**: Expand to additional platforms
5. **Analytics and Insights**: Develop productivity tracking

## Technical Debt Considerations

While implementing new features, these areas of technical debt should be addressed:

1. **Test Coverage**: Increase unit and integration test coverage
2. **Code Documentation**: Improve inline documentation and API docs
3. **Performance Profiling**: Identify and resolve performance bottlenecks
4. **Accessibility Audit**: Ensure WCAG compliance
5. **Security Review**: Review and enhance security practices

## Conclusion

The Todo App has a solid foundation with its current feature set, but there are numerous opportunities for enhancement. By prioritizing features based on user value and implementation complexity, the application can evolve into a more comprehensive productivity tool while maintaining its clean, intuitive design.
